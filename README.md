# Admin Panel Dashboard

## Description

Admin Panel Dashboard is a full-stack administration platform built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** on the backend, and **Angular** on the frontend.

It provides a modular architecture where all core entities — including Users, Roles, Permissions, Categories, and Customers — are fully CRUD-manageable through dedicated components. In addition, the system integrates **a customer-focused chatbot assistant**, allowing customer-specific prompts and interactions to be managed directly within the platform.

With its secure authentication, flexible role-based access control, and scalable design, the Admin Panel Dashboard ensures that administrative tasks and customer management are unified in a single, professional interface.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure login with JWT access/refresh tokens and optional 2FA
- **RBAC**: Role and permission management with fine-grained access control
- **CRUD Modules**: Full management of Users, Roles, Permissions, Categories, and Customers
- **Chatbot**: Customer-focused chatbot system with toggle-based UI
- **Dashboard**: Quick Actions, System Health, Recent Audit Logs
- **Statistics**: Totals, active/inactive users, and users by role
- **Audit Logs**: Detailed tracking of user actions and system activities
- **Sessions**: Session tracking, management, and audit trail
- **List Views**: Pagination, filtering, and sorting for efficient data handling
- **UI/UX**: Consistent, responsive, card-based design with global style guidelines
